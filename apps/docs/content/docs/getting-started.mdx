<Step>

## Installation

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (16.11.0 or newer) installed on your machine. Sunar requires [discord.js](https://npmjs.com/package/discord.js) as a peer dependency.

```package-install
sunar discord.js
```

</Step>

<Step>
## Initialize the client

Create a new file, e.g., `index.js`, and set up your Discord bot using Sunar.

```js title="src/index.js"
import { Client, load } from 'sunar';

const start = async () => {
	const client = new Client({ intents: [] });

	// stores all sunar modules, you can add more
	// directories by passing them after the "signals"
	// with a comma (e.g. signals,buttons,autocompletes)
	await load('src/{commands,signals}/**/*.{js,ts}');

	client.login('YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN');
};

start();
```

Replace `'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'` with your actual bot token obtained from the
[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

</Step>

<Step>
## Create your first signal

Signals handle events in your Discord bot. Let's create a basic 'ready' signal to log when the bot is online and ready.

```js title="src/signals/ready.js"
import { Signal, execute } from 'sunar';
import { registerCommands } from 'sunar/registry';

const signal = new Signal('ready', { once: true });

execute(signal, async (client) => {
	await registerCommands(client.application);
	console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}`);
});

export { signal };
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Create your first command

Let's create a simple `ping` command that responds with the bot's ping when invoked.

```js title="src/commands/ping.js"
import { Slash, execute } from 'sunar';

const slash = new Slash({
	name: 'ping',
	description: 'Show client ws ping',
});

execute(slash, (interaction) => {
	interaction.reply({
		content: `Client WS Ping: ${interaction.client.ws.ping}`,
	});
});

export { slash };
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Handle interactions

To make the ping command work, add the `interactionCreate` signal to your project to handle interactions:

```js title="src/signals/interaction-create.js"
import { Signal, execute } from 'sunar';
import { handleInteraction } from 'sunar/handlers';

const signal = new Signal('interactionCreate');

execute(signal, async (interaction) => {
	await handleInteraction(interaction);
});

export { signal };
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## File structure

Here's an overview of the project's file structure to help you visualize how files are organized within Sunar.

<Files>
  	<Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
		<Folder name="commands" defaultOpen>
			<File name="ping.js" />
		</Folder>

    	<Folder name="signals" defaultOpen>
    		<File name="interaction-create.js" />
    		<File name="ready.js" />
    	</Folder>

  	</Folder>
	<File name="index.js" />
</Files>

## Next steps

- Customize and expand your commands and signals based on your bot's functionality.
- Dive deeper into command options such as subcommands, options, and permissions to create more complex and versatile interactions.
- Explore comprehensive features like context menu commands, buttons, modals, and more.
