---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v22.12.0 or newer ([download](https://nodejs.org))
- A **Discord account** and a bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## Quick Start (Recommended)

Create a new app with `create-sunar`. This will scaffold your project and install all dependencies.

```npm
npm create sunar
```

You'll be prompted for your project name, language (TypeScript or JavaScript), and features (Biome, TSX, TSUP, Prettier, ESLint, etc).

## Manual Setup

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install dependencies

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (22.12.0 or newer) installed on your machine. Sunar requires [discord.js](https://npmjs.com/package/discord.js) as a peer dependency.

```npm
npm install sunar discord.js
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Initialize your bot client

Create a new file, e.g., `src/index.js`, and set up your Discord bot using Sunar:

```js title="src/index.js"
import { Client, load } from 'sunar';

const start = async () => {
	const client = new Client({ intents: [] });

	// stores all sunar modules, you can add more
	// directories by passing them after the "signals"
	// with a comma (e.g. signals,buttons,autocompletes)
	await load("src/{commands,signals}/**/*.{js,ts}");

	client.login('YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN');
};

start();
```

<Callout>
	To learn more about how `load()` works and how to customize what gets loaded, see the [Load modules guide](/docs/guides/load-modules).
</Callout>

<Callout>
	Replace `'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'` with your actual bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
</Callout>


</Step>

<Step>

### Add a ready signal

Signals handle Discord events. Let's log when the bot is online:

```js title="src/signals/ready.js"
import { Signal, Signals, execute } from 'sunar';
import { registerCommands } from 'sunar/registry';

const signal = new Signal(Signals.ClientReady, { once: true });

execute(signal, async (client) => {
	await registerCommands(client.application);
	console.log("Commands registered");

	console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}`);
});

export { signal };
```

<Callout type="warning">
	Avoid registering commands repeatedly in a short time—Discord rate limits apply. Use the `--register` flag to control registration timing. See [Using the `--register` flag](/docs/guides/registering-commands#using-the-register-flag) section.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Create your first command

Let's add a simple `ping` command:

```js title="src/commands/ping.js"
import { Slash, execute } from 'sunar';

const slash = new Slash({
	name: 'ping',
	description: 'Show client ws ping',
});

execute(slash, (interaction) => {
	interaction.reply({
		content: `Client WS Ping: ${interaction.client.ws.ping}`,
	});
});

export { slash };
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Handle interactions

Add the `interactionCreate` signal to handle command execution:

```js title="src/signals/interaction-create.js"
import { Signal, execute } from 'sunar';
import { handleInteraction } from 'sunar/handlers';

const signal = new Signal('interactionCreate');

execute(signal, async (interaction) => {
	await handleInteraction(interaction);
});

export { signal };
```

<Callout type="warning">
	Make sure to include `interaction-create.js`, or your commands won't be executed!
</Callout>

<Callout>
	For more on interaction handling, see the [handle interactions guide](/docs/guides/interactions-handling).
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Test your bot

Run your bot and you should see:

```
Logged in as MyBot#1234
```

Try using `/ping` in your Discord server to verify everything works!

</Step>
</Steps>

## File structure

Here's how your project should look:

<Files>
	<Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
		<Folder name="commands" defaultOpen>
			<File name="ping.js" />
		</Folder>
		<Folder name="signals" defaultOpen>
			<File name="interaction-create.js" />
			<File name="ready.js" />
		</Folder>
	</Folder>
	<File name="index.js" />
</Files>

## What next?

- Customize and expand your commands and signals based on your bot's functionality.
- Dive deeper into command options such as subcommands, options, and permissions to create more complex and versatile interactions.
- Explore comprehensive features like context menu commands, buttons, modals, and more.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="single" collapsible>
	<Accordion title="My command doesn't show up">
		**Check:**
		- You're registering the commands, check [registering commands guide](/docs/guides/registering-commands).
		- Commands are registered globally or per-guild as intended.
		- If per-guild, `GUILD_ID` is set correctly.
		- Global commands can take up to **~1 hour** to appear — use [guild registration](/docs/guides/registering-commands#registering-for-specific-guilds-recommended-for-development) for development.
	</Accordion>

	<Accordion title="My bot doesn't reply">
		**Check:**
		- `interactionCreate` signal is implemented and calls `handleInteraction`.
		- Bot has permission to respond in the channel.
		- Command has a valid `execute` function and returns a reply.
		- No unhandled promise rejections in your console.
	</Accordion>

	<Accordion title="Changes to my commands are not reflected">
		**Check:**
		- Use guild registration for faster updates (Discord caches commands).
		- Delete old commands manually in the Discord Developer Portal if needed.
		- Restart your bot after changing command files.
	</Accordion>

	<Accordion title="I'm getting 'Missing Access' or 'Missing Permissions' errors">
		**Check:**
		- Bot has **OAuth2 scopes**: `bot` and `applications.commands`.
		- Bot has required permissions in the server and channel.
		- No permission middleware or protectors are blocking the command.
	</Accordion>

	<Accordion title="Modules are not being loaded">
		**Check:**
		- Use `/` (forward slash) in `load()` glob patterns, not `\\` (backslash).
		- Export builders correctly (e.g., `export { slash }`).
		- Use ESM only (`type: "module"` in `package.json`).
	</Accordion>

	<Accordion title="Bot is running, but nothing works">
		**Check:**
		- `client.login()` is called with a valid token.
		- Use `console.log()` in your `ready` signal to confirm login.
		- Files needed at runtime are not ignored in `.gitignore` or `.npmignore`.
	</Accordion>
</Accordions>
