title: Load modules
description: Modules in Sunar encapsulate related commands, signals and components, enabling efficient organization and management of your bot's capabilities. Learn how to leverage Sunar's modular architecture to streamline development and scalability.
---

## Example

All you have to do is use the `load` function and use a [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) pattern:

```js title="src/index.js"
import { Client, load } from 'sunar';

const client = new Client(/* your options */);

const start = async () => {
	// you can add more directories to load by
	// passing them with a comma after "signals"
	await load('src/{commands,signals}/**/*.{js,ts}'); // [!code highlight]

	return client.login('YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN');
};

start();
```

<Callout>
	Replace `'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'` with your actual bot token obtained from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
</Callout>

<Callout>
	If you are using ECMAScript modules, you can use the [top-level await](https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await) feature and avoid the `start` function.

## File structure

Here's an overview of the project's file structure to help you visualize how files are organized within Sunar.

<Files>
  	<Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
		<Folder name="commands" defaultOpen>
			<File name="ping.js" />
		</Folder>

    	<Folder name="signals" defaultOpen>
    		<File name="interaction-create.js" />
    		<File name="ready.js" />
    	</Folder>
