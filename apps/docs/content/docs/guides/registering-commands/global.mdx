Global registration allows commands to be registered universally across all servers where the bot is present, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency in command availability across Discord communities.

```js title="src/signals/ready.js"
import { Signal, execute } from 'sunar';
import { registerGlobalCommands } from 'sunar/registry';

const signal = new Signal('ready', { once: true });

execute(signal, async (client) => {
	await registerGlobalCommands(client.application);

	console.log(`${client.user.tag} logged!`);
});

export { signal };
```

Using this method is ideal for production environments as it ensures your commands are accessible across all servers your bot is in.
