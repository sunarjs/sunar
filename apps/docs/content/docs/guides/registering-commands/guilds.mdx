Guilds registration involves registering all commands specifically for a list of servers passed directly through a function call, ensuring commands are tailored and accessible only to designated servers.

```js title="src/signals/ready.js"
import { Signal, execute } from 'sunar';
import { registerGuildCommands } from 'sunar/registry';

const signal = new Signal('ready', { once: true });

execute(signal, async (client) => {
	await registerGuildCommands(client.application, ['YOUR_GUILD_ID']);

	console.log(`${client.user.tag} logged!`);
});

export { signal };
```

<Callout>Replace `'YOUR_GUILD_ID'` with your actual guild IDs.</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
It is recommended to use this method only in development environments as it allows you to test commands without affecting all servers your bot is in.
