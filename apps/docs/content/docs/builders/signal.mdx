## Implementation

The following example demonstrates how to implement a Signal using Sunar:

```js
import { Signal, execute } from 'sunar';
import { TextChannel } from 'discord.js';

const signal = new Signal('guildMemberAdd');

execute(signal, (member) => {
	const channel = member.guild.channels.cache.find(
		(c) => c.name === 'welcomes',
	);

	if (!(channel instanceof TextChannel)) return;

	channel.send({ content: `${member} just joined!` });
});

export { signal };
```
